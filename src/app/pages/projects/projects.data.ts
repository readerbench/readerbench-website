        description: 'RAGE aims to develop, transform and enrich advanced technologies from the leisure games industry into self-contained gaming assets (i.e. solutions showing economic value potential) that support game studios at developing applied games easier, faster and more cost-effectively. These assets will be available along with a large volume of high-quality knowledge resources through a self-sustainable Ecosystem, which is a social space that connects research, gaming industries, intermediaries, education providers, policy makers and end-users. RAGE - Realising an Applied Gaming Eco-system, is a 48-months Technology and Know-How driven Research and Innovation project co-funded by EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, Horizon 2020.',

        description: 'The outcomes of the LTfLL project are prototypes of next-generation services built on advanced research on the application of language technologies in education. Their exploitation to a consumer market requires some further development (on usability, transferability to other domains and other learning environments, etc.).The target groups (as targeted people) of the LTfLL outcomes can be grouped in three: Researchers and developers, Content service providers and End-users of the LTfLL services. The LTfLL project is partially supported/co-funded by the European Union under the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) theme of the 7th Framework Programme for R&D (FP7-ICT-2007-1-4.1)',
